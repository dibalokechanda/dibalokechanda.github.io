## About Me:

I am a CS graduate student at Marquette University, Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

## What if you find a mistake?

Most of the topics I cover are also new to me and it is totally possible for me to misinterpret a concept or make a mistake. Please do let me know if I have any errors via email (dibaloke.chanda@marqutte.edu).
