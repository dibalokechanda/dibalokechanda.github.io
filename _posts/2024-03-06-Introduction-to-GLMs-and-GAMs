In this article, I am going to give a beginner-friendly introduction to generalized linear models (GLMs) and generalized additive models (GAMs).

# Generalized Linear Models (GLM) 

This starts with the idea about the ordinary least squares (OLS) and the assumptions we make when we fit an OLS. One of the assumptions is the response variable follows a Gaussian distribution with constant variance.
