Convex Optimization is a huge topic with thousands of research works published in this domain. Before the Deep learning revolution started, they were one of the coolest approaches to solving optimization problems. I will attempt to cover some prerequisite concepts that need to be learned before delving into convex optimization theory.

Most of this post is from [Convex Optimization – Boyd and Vandenberghe](https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/). Interested readers can refer to it for more details.





## Convex Sets

![convex_sets](https://i.ibb.co/tC3GG3v/chrome-t-W3nv-Re2-A2.png)

A set $C$ is convex if the line segment between any two points in $C$ lies in $C$, i.e. if for any $x_1, x_2 \in C$ and any $\theta$ with $0\leq\theta\leq 1$, we have

$$
\theta x_1+(1-\theta) x_2 \in C
$$

Here, $\theta x_1+(1-\theta) x_2 $ represents all possible points in the line segment between $x_1$ and $x_2$ by letting $\theta$ vary.

The above picture shows a visualization of a convex set and a non-convex set in 2D and 3D. But this is a really general concept that can be easily extended to any number of dimensions.
