Evidence lower bound, commonly known as <b>ELBO</b> is one of the fundamental concepts to understand variational inference and also probabilistic decision theory. I am going to assume that readers are familiar with Bayes Theorem which a prerequisite concept. If you are not I encourage you to go through some materials like this [video](https://youtu.be/j4yxsEQqPMI?list=PL05umP7R6ij0bo4UtMdzEJ6TiLOqj4ZCm).

## Intractability of Distribution

The main reason to come up with the concept of ELBO (at least originally) is due to the intractability of computing distributions in higher dimensions. In my article about [latent variable models](https://dibalokechanda.github.io/posts/latent-variable-model-blog/) I mention the intractability of the following quantity in higher dimensions. 

$$
p(x)=\int_z p(x \mid z) p(z) d z
$$

Remember that computing this quantity was a sub-goal, the main goal was to compute the posterior shown in the following equation:

$$
p(z \mid x) = \frac{p(x\mid z) p(z)}{\int_z  p(x\mid z) \ p(z)}
$$

If we cannot compute $\int_z  p(x\mid z) \ p(z)$, then we cannot compute $p(z \mid x) $. Now rather than trying to compute the exact value for $p(z \mid x)$ we use variational inference to approximate it with another distribution. In this article, I do not want to go deep into variational inference. Hence, the following section gives a small informal introduction to variational inference.
