# Conditional Independence

Before going into this topic, it is better to review the concept of independence between random variables. Suppose $a$ and $b$ are two random variables and they respectively follow the probability distribution $P(a)$ and $P(b)$. We can say $a$ and $b$ are independent if,

$$
P(a,b)=P(a) P(b)
$$

where, $P(a,b)$  is the joint distribution of $a$ and $b$. 

This can be generalized to more than two random variables. 


To formulate the framework for conditional independence, we need three random variables $a$, $b$, and $c$. Suppose they follow the probability distribution $P(a)$, $P(b)$ and $P(c)$. We say random variables $a$ and $b$ are conditionally independent given $c$ if the following expression is true in general:


$$
P(a,b|c) = P(a|c) P(b|c)
$$

Now there is a better notation to express this in a concise manner which is $a \perp b ~|~ c$


## Conditional Independence in Directed Graphical Model

First of all,  let's summarise the concept of a directed graphical model. In short, it presents the dependencies among random variables through a directed acyclic graph, where nodes correspond to variables and directed edges indicate direct influences between them. Now to understand the conditional independence in the context of PGM, we can consider three diagrams.
