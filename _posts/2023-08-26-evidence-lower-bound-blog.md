Evidence lower bound, commonly known as <b>ELBO</b> is one of the fundamental concepts to understand variational inference and also probabilistic decision theory. I am going to assume that readers are familiar with Bayes Theorem which a prerequisite concept. If you are not I encourage you to go through some materials like this [video](https://youtu.be/j4yxsEQqPMI?list=PL05umP7R6ij0bo4UtMdzEJ6TiLOqj4ZCm).
