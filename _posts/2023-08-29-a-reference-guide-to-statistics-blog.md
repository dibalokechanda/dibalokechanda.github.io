This article acts as a repository of the concepts I learned about any topics in Statistics. I plan to use this as a reference for ideas/concepts/formulas in Statistics. Essentially this is a look-up reference guide; if I forget any specific topic, I can revise that topic again. A significant portion of these concepts is based on the videos from the following YouTube channels.

- [Simple Learning Pro](https://www.youtube.com/@Simplelearningpro/videos)
- [jbstatistics](https://www.youtube.com/@jbstatistics/videos)
- [zedstatistics](https://www.youtube.com/@zedstatistics/videos)

In addition, several blog posts and texts are also used as references. 


## Inferential Statistics 


>### Sampling 

*References:* [Sampling Distributions (7.2)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7S7j75d3GM4)

 - A <b>Sample</b> is a small portion of the population that we examine and draw conclusions from.

 - The <b>process</b> of drawing a sample from the population is known as sampling. 


#### Sample Distribution

When we draw a particular sample from a distribution, that specific sample creates a distribution. This is known as the "sample distribution".

#### Sampling Distribution

The sampling distribution of a <b>statistic</b> is the probability distribution of that <b>statistic</b>. This means if we draw samples from the <b>population</b> a bunch of times, the distribution associated with a particular <b>statistic</b> is referred to as the <b>sampling</b> distribution. 

For example, let's use "mean" as the statistic. In that case, given a population (say all people in Wisconsin) and a random variable (say weight) we have a "true" population distribution of people's weights. Most of the time we don't have access to this distribution and not having access to this distribution means having no access to
