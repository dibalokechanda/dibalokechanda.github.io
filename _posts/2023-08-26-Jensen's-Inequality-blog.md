## The Basic Idea

Jensen's inequality requires prerequisite knowledge about the definition of convex functions. I will assume the readers are somewhat familiar with convexitiy of functions.

Jensen's inequality is one of most fundamental concept which connects a lot of different ideas in information theory. Most of things we taken for granted in information theory or hand-wave with intuition are proved with Jensen's inequality.

The Statement says that given a convex function $f(\cdot)$ and a random variable $X$ the following inequality relation holds true:

$$
f(\mathbb{E}[X]) \leq \mathbb{E}[f(X)]
$$
